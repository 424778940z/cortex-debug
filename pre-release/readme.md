haneefdm: This is super experimental. I want to see if I can put pre-release VSIX files here that users can pickup. VSCode does not have any way to push alpha/beta releases. So, perhaps interested users can pickup from here.

In the next few days, I will be experimenting with this mechanism myself. I will publish instructions once I figure out what they are.
